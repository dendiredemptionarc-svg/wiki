The message was simple, but shocking.

Everyone was told to **send all badges back**.

The video attached to the post framed the announcement as a formal address, congratulating participants for enduring an intense program, while hinting at escalating threats beyond the walls. With GBOY being the described threat and center of the narrative.

## Video Transcript (Key Excerpt)

> “I want to start by thanking you all for being here.  
>  
> This is one of the most rigorous programs in the world.  
> Even when things go smoothly - and your steadfast dedication  
> to improving yourselves in the face of these difficult physical  
> and mental trials, for the good of our missions, for the good of  
> our country - it’s truly been astounding.  
>  
> You’ve all become worthy of your badges.  
>  
> And I know you’ve probably seen G*BOY starting to show up  
> outside these walls, propelled by that awful group of the  
> cryptocurrency hackers, **The Bloc**.  
>  
> Well, do we have good news for you today.  
>  
> **G304 has been found.**  
>  
> Agent K and the Nocturne Squadron are moments away  
> from putting this G*BOY issue behind us.”

The tone suggested resolution.

Then everything flipped.

## The Twist

A sudden interruption reframed the entire situation:

> “Hey guys, it’s me - Z*LINE.  
> We’ve got a crazy idea.  
>  
> **TURN IN ALL BADGES.**  
>  
> **YOU HAVE 48 HOURS.**  
>  
> **TO SAVE G*BOY.**”

## ARG Status

Despite the dramatic announcement, **no puzzle or ARG mechanics** were discovered in this post.

For once, the decoding crew was allowed to pause - at least until the next transmission.

---

## Community Reaction

The timing couldn’t have been more ironic.

A brand-new holder had just purchased a badge, joined Telegram…  
and the **first thing they saw** was an instruction to send it away.

Naturally, the community response was instant.

The Bloc writes its own punchlines.
